# openstreetmap-geocoding-visualisation
This project uses the free **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** to convert university names entered by users into geographical locations (latitude and longitude) and displays these locations on an OpenStreetMap map.  The processed data is stored in an SQLite database (`opengeo.sqlite`), which can be used for further analysis or visualizations.
